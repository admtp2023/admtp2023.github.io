Christopher Jennison is Professor of Statistics at the University of Bath, UK. His PhD research at Cornell University concerned the sequential analysis of clinical trials and he has continued to work in this area for almost 40 years. His book with Professor Bruce Turnbull, "Group Sequential Methods with Applications to Clinical Trials", is a standard text on this topic and is widely used by practising statisticians. The second edition of this book, extended to cover adaptive designs, is finally nearing completion.

Professor Jennison's research is informed by experience of clinical trial analysis at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, by service on data monitoring committees, and by a broad range of consultancy with pharmaceutical companies.
